Technical Setup:

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) - Latest version with privacy-focused tracking
Tracking Code - Small JavaScript snippet added to all pages
Measurement ID - Your unique identifier (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
Event Tracking - Custom code to track specific actions
What Happens:

Visitor opens your website → GA4 code loads
Automatic tracking begins (page views, time, location)
Custom events fire when users click buttons (WhatsApp, Add to Wishlist)
Data sent to Google Analytics dashboard
You view reports in real-time or historical
📋 Implementation Plan
Here's what I would add to your website:

1. Core Setup:
Add GA4 tracking script to all HTML pages (header section)
Configure your Measurement ID securely
Set up basic page view tracking
2. Custom Event Tracking:
Product Views - Track when someone opens a product modal
WhatsApp Clicks - Track inquiry button clicks with product name
Category Filters - Track which categories users browse
Wishlist Actions - Track add/remove from wishlist
Blog Engagement - Track which blog posts are opened
Search Usage - Track what users search for
3. Enhanced Ecommerce (Optional):
Track product impressions (which products are seen)
Track category performance
WhatsApp inquiry funnel (view → click → inquiry)
4. Privacy Compliance:
Cookie consent banner (GDPR/PDPA compliant)
Privacy policy update mentioning analytics
IP anonymization for privacy
🎯 What You'll Learn:
Business Insights:

📈 Best-selling categories - Which sarees to stock more of
🌍 Customer locations - Where to focus marketing
📱 Device preferences - Optimize for mobile/desktop
⏰ Peak visit times - Best time to post on social media
🔗 Top traffic sources - Where to invest marketing budget
Content Performance:

Which blog posts drive traffic
Which products get most interest

💡 Additional Tracking Options:
Beyond Google Analytics, I could also add:

Meta Pixel (Facebook/Instagram ads tracking)
Google Tag Manager (easier event management)
Hotjar/Microsoft Clarity (heatmaps showing where users click)
WhatsApp Business API (track conversation conversions)
🔐 Important Security Note:
Your Analytics Measurement ID should be stored securely! While it's not as sensitive as an API key, I'll configure it properly to avoid exposing it unnecessarily. For sensitive tracking (like conversion values), we'd use Replit's secure integrations.
